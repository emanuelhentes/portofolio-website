I am a PhD Candidate at the Faculty of Social and Behavioural Sciences, Utrecht University. My research project focuses on education and makes use of administrative data and quasi-experimental statistical methods to provide causal evidence. I am currently working on my first paper about the (causal) effect of religious schooling on achievement.
