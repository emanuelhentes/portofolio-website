I am a PhD Candidate at the Faculty of Social and Behavioural Sciences, Utrecht University. My research focuses on education and makes use of administrative data and quasi-experimental statistical methods to provide causal evidence. This PhD project is carried out as part of the larger EU-funded [EFFEct project](https://feb.kuleuven.be/drc/LEER/effect-project/effect-team) (*Enhancing Efficiency and Effectiveness in Education*). I am currently working on my first paper about the (causal) effect of religious schooling on achievement.
